# Bagels

Please go to https://francoisboulou.github.io/bagels/ for the live version. A version of the Pico, Fermi, Bagel number game, built with React, bootstrapped with create-react-app.

I am a fan of the Web Developer Roadmap (https://hackernoon.com/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e) and attempt to cover a few concepts in it with every project. The main ideas/technologies covered in this project are:

* React components/functions
* ES6 syntax (arrow funtcions, promises, map/filter/reduce)
* APIs
* Use of NPM and YARN package managers

 # Some Things I Learned on This Project

* Became familiar with writing modular JS, using components, and passing props in React 
* Managing state and using callbacks to pass information to parent components
* Used knowledge of component lifecycle methods and ES6 features to interact with API (Axios module)

# Some Challenges

* Finding a workaround to Chrome's new autoplay restrictions was a bit difficult, but I was able to find a reasonable solution through looking over online resources. 

* Everything about React! Just kidding, but not really. It was all very confusing at first, but I must admit the more I use it, the more straightforward it seems. 

# Things Left to Do

* Create animations for smooth presentation of difficulty options, instructions, and illegal moves
* Adding music and sound effects to play and win screens to enhance the play experience
* Continue to add and refine animations that enhance the play experience
* Refine my code for performance, and to adhere to React conventions (adding keys to array items, for example)

# Other considerations

I have intentionally left mobile formatting and accessibility concerns out of my to-do list for this project, as its main intention is to display my knowledge of React and ES6.
