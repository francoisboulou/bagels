# Bagels

Please go to https://francoisboulou.github.io/bagels/ for the live version. A version of the Pico, Fermi, Bagel number game, built with React, bootstrapped with create-react-app.

I am a fan of the Web Developer Roadmap (https://hackernoon.com/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e) and attempt to cover a few concepts in it with every project. The main ideas/technologies covered in this project are:

* React components/functions
* ES6 syntax (arrow funtcions, promises, map/filter/reduce)
* APIs
* Use of NPM and YARN package managers

Other considerations: 

 * Semantic HTML
 * Accessibility
 * Mobile responsiveness
 
# Some Things I Did on This Project

* Became familiar with writing modular JS, using components, and passing props in React 
* Managing state and using callbacks to pass information to parent components
* Used knowledge of component lifecycle methods and ES6 features to interact with API (Axios module)


# Things Left to Do

* Create animations for smooth presentation of difficulty options, instructions, and illegal moves
* Adding an play/pause audio component that plays background music, to enhance the play experience
* Continue to add and refine animations that enhance the play experience
